## Export workflows as Groovy script for QuPath
You can export Groovy scripts for single-channel image analysis to QuPath. 
Only workflows which result in binary images are supported for now. 
In order to make them work, please follow the [CluPath](https://clij.github.io/clupath/) installation instructions.
