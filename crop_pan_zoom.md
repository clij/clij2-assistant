# Crop, Pan & Zoom
When optimizing workflows, is might make sense to do that on a sub-volume of a bigger stack, just to spare time while optimizing parameters.
Therefore, there is a Crop operation for cropping a sub-region. This sub-region can be panned while more operations are
attached to its result. Furthermore, there is a Zoom operation for inspecting results in more detail.
