# Intensity projection
CLIJx-Assistant has these intensity projections in Z available:
* Maximum Z Projection
* Minimum Z Projection
* Mean Z Projection
* Mean Z Projection of pixels above a given threshold
* Median Z Projection
* Standard Deviation Z Projection

You can increase contrast in visualisation of your sample by executing [background subtraction](https://clij.github.io/assistant/filtering) in advance.

## How to do intensity projections
Open your time lapse data set. [Start the CLIJx-assistant](https://clij.github.io/assistant/getting_started) and follow these steps:

* Your dataset
  * CLIJx-Assistant Starting point
    * Background subtraction
      * Maximum Z Projection

Furthermore, if you want to project in different directions, consider these methods:
* Reslice Left
* Reslice Right
* Reslice Top
* Reslice Bottom
* Transpose XY
* Transpose XZ
* Transpose YZ
