## Export human readable protocols
Just like [generating scripts](https://clij.github.io/assistant/macro_export), one can also
generate human readable protocols of workflows. Just click the right-click menu `Generate Script > Human readable protocol`.

Note: As modern reference / citation checking tools might detect these generated texts as illegal citations, it is 
recommended to mark these texts as generated.
