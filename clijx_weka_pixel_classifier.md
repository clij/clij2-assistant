# Pixel classification (Weka)
For 2D image processing, a binary pixel classifier based on [Trainable Weka Segmentation](https://imagej.net/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation) is available.

Annotate your dataset using the annotator tool and run `Binary` > `Binary Weka Pixel Classifier`.
Enter where the model should be saved. Train the model using `More Actions` > `Train Weka Fast Random Forest Classifier`. 
It is also possible to enter a pre-existing model and skip the annotaiton step.

Note: For technical reasons, the model files are not compatible with traditional Trainable Weka Segmentation.
