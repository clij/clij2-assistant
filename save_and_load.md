## Saving and loaging workflows
Workflows can be saved as groovy scripts. These scripts allow you to re-open an earlier created workflow and continue to
work on it. 
Just use the main menut `Plugins > ImageJ on GPU (CLIJx-Assistant) > Save image data flow (experimental)"` to save the 
current configuration and analogously, `Plugins>ImageJ on GPU (CLIJx-Assistant), "Load image data flow (experimental)"`
to reopen an formely saved configuration.

Note: These groovy files are not meant to be edited. If you want to create scripts for image analysis scripts for automation,
which can be edited, check out the [Export workflows as ImageJ Script](https://clij.github.io/assistant/macro_export) section.
